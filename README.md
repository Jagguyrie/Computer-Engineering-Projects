# Computer-Engineering-Projects

### What is this repository?
This repository is an archive of most of the programming projects and experiments/assignments done as a part of my 4 year Computer Engineering course at NMIMS, Navi Mumbai.

### Structure:
**Heirarchy is as follows:**
1. The year
2. The semester
3. The course
4. Work type (Project/Assignment/Experiment)

### Why should I care?
This repository aims to help newcomers and young exploring programming enthusiasts to have a look at the type of topics covered and projects made.
A secondary goal of this repository is to make available, the project work for programming specific courses so that students do not need to re-invent the wheel, instead use available information and add their own input and personalize their project while learning by doing things hands-on.

## Note that there are many topics missing and is a work in progress
